<p>
      The way theming works in GTK+ has been reworked fundamentally, to
      implement many more CSS features and make themes more expressive.
      As a result, custom CSS that is shipped with applications and third-party
      themes will need adjustments. Widgets now use element names much more
      than style classes; type names are no longer used in style matching.
      Every widget now documents the element names it has and the style classes
      it uses. The GTK+ inspector can also help with finding this information.
    </p>
<p>
      GTK+ now uses internal subobjects (also known as gadgets) for allocating
      and drawing widget parts. Applications that subclass GTK+ widgets may see
      warnings if they override the size_allocate vfunc and don't chain up.
      The proper way to subclass is to chain up in size_allocate. If you do not
      want to do that for some reason, you have to override the draw vfunc as
      well.
    </p>
<p>
      Several fixes for window sizing and window placement with client-side
      decorations may affect applications that are saving and restoring window
      sizes. The recommended best practice for this which is known to work with
      client-side and server-side decorations and with older and newer versions
      of GTK+ is to use <a class="link" href="GtkWindow.html#gtk-window-get-size" title="gtk_window_get_size ()"><code class="function">gtk_window_get_size()</code></a> to save window sizes and
      <a class="link" href="GtkWindow.html#gtk-window-set-default-size" title="gtk_window_set_default_size ()"><code class="function">gtk_window_set_default_size()</code></a> to restore it.
      See https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/SaveWindowState for a detailed example.
    </p>
<p>
      Geometry handling in GtkWindow has been removed. If you are using the
      functions gtk_window_resize_to_geometry, gtk_window_set_default_geometry,
      gtk_window_parse_geometry or gtk_window_set_geometry_hints, you may need
      to make some changes to your code.
    </p>
<p>
      GtkDrawingArea used to implicitly render the theme background before
      calling the ::draw handler. This is no longer the case. If you rely
      on having a theme-provided background, call <a class="link" href="GtkStyleContext.html#gtk-render-background" title="gtk_render_background ()"><code class="function">gtk_render_background()</code></a>
      from your ::draw handler.
    </p>
<p>
      The GtkFileChooser interface prerequisite changed from GtkWidget
      to GObject, allowing non-widget implementations of this interface.
      This is a minor change in ABI, as applications are no longer guaranteed
      that a GtkFileChooser also supports all GtkWidget methods. However, all
      previously existing implementations still derive from GtkWidget, so no
      existing code should break.
    </p>
<p>
      The way in which GtkLevelBar determines the offset to apply was a bit
      inconsistent in the past; this has been fixed. Applications that are using
      custom offsets should double-check that their levels look as expected.
